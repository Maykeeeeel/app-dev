## Favorite series of Titanic
*Rose finally agrees to go aboard the lifeboat when the Titanic is sinking. She feels uneasy without Jack on the lifeboat since the rule is women and children first. As she is lowered down to the water on the boat she gets one last glimmer of Jack and when she is at level at the balcony she jumps back on the Titanic since she wanted to be with the man who saved her from committing suicide.*
